These are course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics) for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/) initiative. This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R.

During the workshop we will be using R on a server we run. However R is free, and you can install it on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

(R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R.)
