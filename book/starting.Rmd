# Starting out in R

R is both a programming language and an interactive environment for statistics. Today we will be concentrating on R as an *interactive environment*.

Working with R is primarily text-based. The basic mode of use for R is that the user types in a command in the R language and presses enter, and then R computes and displays the result.

We will be working in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). This surrounds the *console*, where one enters commands and views the results, with various conveniences. In addition to the console, RStudio provides panels containing:

* A *text editor*, where R commands can be recorded for future reference.
* A history of commands that have been typed on the console.
* An "environment" pane with a list of *variables*, which contain values that R has been told to save from previous commands.
* A file manager.
* Help on the functions available in R.
* A panel to show plots.

```{r echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/rstudio.png")
```

Open RStudio, click on the "Console" pane, type `1+1` and press enter. R displays the result of the calculation. In this document, we will be showing such an interaction with R as below.

```{r}
1+1
```

`+` is called an operator. R has the operators you would expect for for basic mathematics: `+` `-` `*` `/` `^`. It also has operators that do more obscure things.

`*` has higher precedence than `+`.  We can use brackets if necessary `( )`. Try `1+2*3` and `(1+2)*3`.

Spaces can be used to make code easier to read.

We can compare with `== < > <= >=`. This produces a *logical* value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Note the double equals, `==`, for equality comparison.

```{r}
2 * 2 == 4
```

There are also character strings such as `"string"`.



## Variables

A variable is a name for a value. We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using `<-`.

```{r}
width <- 5
```

RStudio helpfully shows us the variable in the "Environment" pane. We can also print it by typing the name of the variable and hitting enter. In general, R will print to the console any object returned by a function or operation *unless* we assign it to a variable.

```{r}
width
```

Examples of valid variables names: `hello`, `subject_id`, `subject.ID`, `x42`. Spaces aren't ok *inside* variable names. Dots (`.`) are ok in R, unlike in many other languages. Numbers are ok, except as the first character. Punctuation isn't ok, with two: `_` and `.`.

We can do arithmetic with the variable:

```{r}
# Area of a square
width * width
```

and even save the result in another variable:

```{r}
# Save area in "area" variable
area <- width * width
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new value:

```{r}
width <- 10
width
area
```

Notice that the value of `area` we calculated earlier hasn't been updated. Assigning a new value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. This is different to a spreadsheet, but usual for programming languages.


## Saving code in an R script

Once we've created a few variables, it becomes important to record how they were calculated, so we can reproduce them later.

The usual workflow is to save your code in an R script (".R file"). Go to "File/New File/R Script" to create a new R script. Code in your R script can be sent to the console by selecting it (or just placing the cursor on the correct line), and then pressing **Control-Enter** (or **Command-Enter** on a Mac).

### Tip {- .tip}

Add comments to code, using lines starting with the `#` character. This makes it easier for others to follow what the code is doing (and also for us the next time we come back to it).



## Vectors

A *vector* of numbers is a collection of numbers. "Vector" can mean different things in different fields (mathematics, geometry, biology), but in R it is a fancy name for a collection of numbers. We call the individual numbers *elements* of the vector.

We can make vectors with `c( )`, for example `c(1,2,3)`. `c` means "combine". R is obsesssed with vectors. In R, numbers are just vectors of length one. Many things that can be done with a single number can also be done with a vector. For example arithmetic can be done on vectors as it can be on single numbers.

```{r}
myvec <- c(10,20,30,40,50)
myvec
myvec + 1
myvec + myvec
length(myvec)
c(60, myvec)
c(myvec, myvec)
```

When we talk about the length of a vector, we are talking about the number of numbers in the vector.

## Types of vector

We will also encounter vectors of character strings, for example `"hello"` or `c("hello","world")`. Also we will encounter "logical" vectors, which contain `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. R also has "factors", which are categorical vectors, and behave much like character vectors (think the factors in an experiment).


### Challenge: mixing types {- .challenge}

Sometimes the best way to understand R is to try some examples and see what it does.

What happens when you try to make a vector containing different types, using `c( )`? Make a vector with some numbers, and some words (eg. character strings like `"test"`, or `"hello"`).

Why does the output show the numbers surrounded by quotes `" "` like character strings are?

### {-}

Because vectors can only contain one type of thing, R chooses a lowest common denominator type of vector, a type that can contain everything we are trying to put in it. A different language might stop with an error, but R tries to soldier on as best it can. A number can be represented as a character string, but a character string can not be represented as a number, so when we try to put both in the same vector R converts everything to a character string.


## Indexing vectors

Access elements of a vector with `[ ]`, for example `myvec[1]` to get the first element. You can also assign to a specific element of a vector.

```{r}
myvec[1]
myvec[2]
myvec[2] <- 5
myvec
```

Can we use a vector to index another vector? Yes!

```{r}
myind <- c(4,3,2)
myvec[myind]
```

We could equivalently have written:

```{r}
myvec[c(4,3,2)]
```

### Challenge: indexing {- .challenge}

We can create and index character vectors as well. A cafe is using R to create their menu.

```{r}
items <- c("spam", "eggs", "beans", "bacon", "sausage")
```

1. What does `items[-3]` produce? Based on what you find, use indexing to create a version of `items` without `"spam"`.

2. Use indexing to create a vector containing spam, eggs, sausage, spam, and spam.

3. Add a new item, "lobster", to `items`.


## Sequences

Another way to create a vector is with `:`:

```{r}
1:10
```

This can be useful when combined with indexing:

```{r}
items[1:4]
```

Sequences are useful for many other things, such as a starting point for calculations:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x*x
plot(x, x*x)
```


## Functions

Functions are the things that do all the work for us in R: calculate, manipulate data, read and write to files, produce plots. Because R is a language for statistics, it has many built in statistics-related functions. We will also be loading more specialized functions from "packages".

We've already seen several functions: `c( )`, `length( )`, and `plot( )`. Let's now have a look at `sum( )`. 

```{r}
sum(myvec)
```

We *called* the function `sum` with the *argument* `myvec`, and it *returned* the value 135. We can get help on how to use `sum` with:

```
?sum
```

Some functions take more than one argument. Let's look at the function `rep`, which means "repeat", and which can take a variety of different arguments. In the simplest case, it takes a value and the number of times to repeat that value.

```{r}
rep(42, 10)
```

As with many functions in R---which is obsessed with vectors---the thing to be repeated can be a vector with multiple elements.

```{r}
rep(c(1,2,3), 10)
```

So far we have used *positional* arguments, where R determines which argument is which by the order in which they are given. We can also give arguments by *name*. For example, the above is equivalent to

```{r}
rep(c(1,2,3), times=10)
rep(x=c(1,2,3), 10)
rep(x=c(1,2,3), times=10)
```

Arguments can have default values, and a function may have many different possible arguments that make it do obscure things. For example, `rep` can also take an argument `each=`. It's typical for a function to be invoked with some number of positional arguments, which are always given, plus some less commonly used arguments, typically given by name.

```{r}
rep(c(1,2,3), each=3)
rep(c(1,2,3), each=3, times=5)
```

### Challenge: using functions {- .challenge}

1. Use `sum` to sum from 1 to 10,000.

2. Look at the documentation for the `seq` function. What does `seq` do? Give an example of using `seq` with either the `by` or `length.out` argument.
