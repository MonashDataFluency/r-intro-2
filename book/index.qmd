This is workshop material for the "Introduction to R" workshop given by the [Monash Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/mgbp) for the [ResBaz Victoria 2024](https://resbaz.github.io/resbazvic2024/). Our teaching style is based on the style of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

* [ZIP of data files used in this workshop](r-intro.zip)

During the workshop we will be using Posit Cloud to use R over the web:

* [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)

You can also install R on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R, either on your local computer or on a server.
