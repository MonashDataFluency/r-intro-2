["starting-out-in-r.html", "1 Starting out in R 1.1 Variables 1.2 Saving code in an R script 1.3 Vectors 1.4 Types of vector 1.5 Indexing vectors 1.6 Sequences 1.7 Functions", " 1 Starting out in R R is both a programming language and an interactive environment for data exploration and statistics. Today we will be concentrating on R as an interactive environment. Working with R is primarily text-based. The basic mode of use for R is that the user types in a command in the R language and presses enter, and then R computes and displays the result. We will be working in RStudio. This surrounds the console, where one enters commands and views the results, with various conveniences. In addition to the console, RStudio provides panels containing: A text editor, where R commands can be recorded for future reference. A history of commands that have been typed on the console. An “environment” pane with a list of variables, which contain values that R has been told to save from previous commands. A file manager. Help on the functions available in R. A panel to show plots. Open RStudio, click on the “Console” pane, type 1+1 and press enter. R displays the result of the calculation. In this document, we will be showing such an interaction with R as below. 1+1 [1] 2 + is called an operator. R has the operators you would expect for for basic mathematics: + - * / ^. It also has operators that do more obscure things. * has higher precedence than +. We can use brackets if necessary ( ). Try 1+2*3 and (1+2)*3. Spaces can be used to make code easier to read. We can compare with == &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=. This produces a logical value, TRUE or FALSE. Note the double equals, ==, for equality comparison. 2 * 2 == 4 [1] TRUE There are also character strings such as &quot;string&quot;. A character string must be surrounded by either single or double quotes. 1.1 Variables A variable is a name for a value. We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using &lt;-. width &lt;- 5 RStudio helpfully shows us the variable in the “Environment” pane. We can also print it by typing the name of the variable and hitting enter. In general, R will print to the console any object returned by a function or operation unless we assign it to a variable. width [1] 5 Examples of valid variables names: hello, subject_id, subject.ID, x42. Spaces aren’t ok inside variable names. Dots (.) are ok in R, unlike in many other languages. Numbers are ok, except as the first character. Punctuation is not allowed, with two exceptions: _ and .. We can do arithmetic with the variable: # Area of a square width * width [1] 25 and even save the result in another variable: # Save area in &quot;area&quot; variable area &lt;- width * width We can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new value: width &lt;- 10 width [1] 10 area [1] 25 Notice that the value of area we calculated earlier hasn’t been updated. Assigning a new value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. This is different to a spreadsheet, but usual for programming languages. 1.2 Saving code in an R script Once we’ve created a few variables, it becomes important to record how they were calculated so we can reproduce them later. The usual workflow is to save your code in an R script (“.R file”). Go to “File/New File/R Script” to create a new R script. Code in your R script can be sent to the console by selecting it or placing the cursor on the correct line, and then pressing Control-Enter (Command-Enter on a Mac). Tip Add comments to code, using lines starting with the # character. This makes it easier for others to follow what the code is doing (and also for us the next time we come back to it). Challenge: using variables Re-write this calculation as a single line of R: a &lt;- 4*20 b &lt;- 7 a+b Re-write this calcuation over multiple lines, using a variable: 2*2+2*2+2*2 1.3 Vectors A vector of numbers is a collection of numbers. “Vector” means different things in different fields (mathematics, geometry, biology), but in R it is a fancy name for a collection of numbers. We call the individual numbers elements of the vector. We can make vectors with c( ), for example c(1,2,3). c means “combine”. R is obsesssed with vectors, in R even single numbers are vectors of length one. Many things that can be done with a single number can also be done with a vector. For example arithmetic can be done on vectors as it can be on single numbers. myvec &lt;- c(10,20,30,40,50) myvec [1] 10 20 30 40 50 myvec + 1 [1] 11 21 31 41 51 myvec + myvec [1] 20 40 60 80 100 length(myvec) [1] 5 c(60, myvec) [1] 60 10 20 30 40 50 c(myvec, myvec) [1] 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50 When we talk about the length of a vector, we are talking about the number of numbers in the vector. 1.4 Types of vector We will also encounter vectors of character strings, for example &quot;hello&quot; or c(&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;). Also we will encounter “logical” vectors, which contain TRUE and FALSE values. R also has “factors”, which are categorical vectors, and behave much like character vectors (think the factors in an experiment). Challenge: mixing types Sometimes the best way to understand R is to try some examples and see what it does. What happens when you try to make a vector containing different types, using c( )? Make a vector with some numbers, and some words (eg. character strings like &quot;test&quot;, or &quot;hello&quot;). Why does the output show the numbers surrounded by quotes &quot; &quot; like character strings are? Because vectors can only contain one type of thing, R chooses a lowest common denominator type of vector, a type that can contain everything we are trying to put in it. A different language might stop with an error, but R tries to soldier on as best it can. A number can be represented as a character string, but a character string can not be represented as a number, so when we try to put both in the same vector R converts everything to a character string. 1.5 Indexing vectors Access elements of a vector with [ ], for example myvec[1] to get the first element. You can also assign to a specific element of a vector. myvec[1] [1] 10 myvec[2] [1] 20 myvec[2] &lt;- 5 myvec [1] 10 5 30 40 50 Can we use a vector to index another vector? Yes! myind &lt;- c(4,3,2) myvec[myind] [1] 40 30 5 We could equivalently have written: myvec[c(4,3,2)] [1] 40 30 5 Challenge: indexing We can create and index character vectors as well. A cafe is using R to create their menu. items &lt;- c(&quot;spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;, &quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;) What does items[-3] produce? Based on what you find, use indexing to create a version of items without &quot;spam&quot;. Use indexing to create a vector containing spam, eggs, sausage, spam, and spam. Add a new item, “lobster”, to items. 1.6 Sequences Another way to create a vector is with :: 1:10 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This can be useful when combined with indexing: items[1:4] [1] &quot;spam&quot; &quot;eggs&quot; &quot;beans&quot; &quot;bacon&quot; Sequences are useful for other things, such as a starting point for calculations: x &lt;- 1:10 x*x [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 plot(x, x*x) 1.7 Functions Functions are the things that do all the work for us in R: calculate, manipulate data, read and write to files, produce plots. R has many built in functions and will also be loading more specialized functions from “packages”. We’ve already seen several functions: c( ), length( ), and plot( ). Let’s now have a look at sum( ). sum(myvec) [1] 135 We called the function sum with the argument myvec, and it returned the value 135. We can get help on how to use sum with: ?sum Some functions take more than one argument. Let’s look at the function rep, which means “repeat”, and which can take a variety of different arguments. In the simplest case, it takes a value and the number of times to repeat that value. rep(42, 10) [1] 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 As with many functions in R—which is obsessed with vectors—the thing to be repeated can be a vector with multiple elements. rep(c(1,2,3), 10) [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 So far we have used positional arguments, where R determines which argument is which by the order in which they are given. We can also give arguments by name. For example, the above is equivalent to rep(c(1,2,3), times=10) [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 rep(x=c(1,2,3), 10) [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 rep(times=10, x=c(1,2,3)) [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Arguments can have default values, and a function may have many different possible arguments that make it do obscure things. For example, rep can also take an argument each=. It’s typical for a function to be invoked with some number of positional arguments, which are always given, plus some less commonly used arguments, typically given by name. rep(c(1,2,3), each=3) [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 rep(c(1,2,3), each=3, times=5) [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 [36] 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 Challenge: using functions Use sum to sum from 1 to 10,000. Look at the documentation for the seq function. What does seq do? Give an example of using seq with either the by or length.out argument. "],

We generally want each row in a data frame to represent a unit of observation, and each column to contain a different type of information about the units of observation. Tabular data in this form is called “tidy data”. Today we will be using a collection of modern packages collectively known as the Tidyverse. R and its predecessor S have a history dating back to 1976. The Tidyverse fixes some dubious design decisions baked into “base R”, including having its own slightly improved form of data frame. Sticking to the Tidyverse where possible is generally safer, Tidyverse packages are more willing to generate errors rather than ignore problems. If the Tidyverse is not already installed, you will need to install it. However on the server we are using today it is already installed. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) People sometimes have problems installing all the packages in Tidyverse on Windows machines. If you run into problems you may have more success installing individual packages. install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;readr&quot;,&quot;tidyr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;)) We need to load the tidyverse package in order to use it. library(tidyverse) # OR library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(ggplot2) The tidyverse package loads various other packages, setting up a modern R environment. In this section we will be using functions from the dplyr, readr and tidyr packages. R is a language with mini-languages within it that solve specific problem domains. dplyr is such a mini-language, a set of “verbs” (functions) that work well together. dplyr, with the help of tidyr for some more complex operations, provides a way to perform most manipulations on a data frame that you might need. 2.1 Loading data We will use the read_csv function from readr to load a data set. (See also read.csv in base R.) geo &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/geo.csv&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( name = col_character(), region = col_character(), oecd = col_logical(), g77 = col_logical(), lat = col_double(), long = col_double(), income2017 = col_character() ) geo # A tibble: 196 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Afghanistan asia FALSE TRUE 33 66 low 2 Albania europe FALSE FALSE 41 20 upper_mid 3 Algeria africa FALSE TRUE 28 3 upper_mid 4 Andorra europe FALSE FALSE 42.5 1.52 high 5 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid 6 Antigua and Barbuda americas FALSE TRUE 17.0 -61.8 high 7 Argentina americas FALSE TRUE -34 -64 upper_mid 8 Armenia europe FALSE FALSE 40.2 45 lower_mid 9 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high 10 Austria europe TRUE FALSE 47.3 13.3 high # ... with 186 more rows read_csv has guessed the type of data each column holds: &lt;chr&gt; - character strings &lt;dbl&gt; - numerical values. Technically these are “doubles”, which is a way of storing numbers with 15 digits precision. &lt;lgl&gt; - logical values, TRUE or FALSE. We will also encounter: &lt;int&gt; - integers, a fancy name for whole numbers. &lt;fct&gt; - factors, categorical data. We will get to this shortly. You can also see this data frame referring to itself as “a tibble”. This is the Tidyverse’s improved form of data frame. Tibbles present themselves more conveniently than base R data frames. Base R data frames don’t show the type of each column, and output every row when you try to view them. Tip A data frame can also be created from vectors, with the data_frame function. (See also data.frame in base R.) For example: data_frame(foo=c(10,20,30), bar=c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) # A tibble: 3 x 2 foo bar &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 10 a 2 20 b 3 30 c The argument names become column names in the data frame. Tip The path to the file on our server is &quot;r-intro-2-files/geo.csv&quot;. This says, starting from your working directory, look in the directory r-intro-2-files for the file geo.csv. The steps in the path are separated by /. Your working directory is shown at the top of the console pane. The path needed might be different on your own computer, depending where you downloaded the file. One way to work out the correct path is to find the file in the file browser pane, click on it and select “Import Dataset…”. 2.2 Exploring The View function gives us a spreadsheet-like view of the data frame. View(geo) print with the n argument can be used to show more than the first 10 rows on the console. print(geo, n=200) We can extract details of the data frame with further functions: nrow(geo) [1] 196 ncol(geo) [1] 7 colnames(geo) [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;region&quot; &quot;oecd&quot; &quot;g77&quot; &quot;lat&quot; [6] &quot;long&quot; &quot;income2017&quot; summary(geo) name region oecd g77 Length:196 Length:196 Mode :logical Mode :logical Class :character Class :character FALSE:165 FALSE:65 Mode :character Mode :character TRUE :31 TRUE :131 lat long income2017 Min. :-42.00 Min. :-175.000 Length:196 1st Qu.: 4.00 1st Qu.: -5.625 Class :character Median : 17.42 Median : 21.875 Mode :character Mean : 19.03 Mean : 23.004 3rd Qu.: 39.82 3rd Qu.: 51.892 Max. : 65.00 Max. : 179.145 2.3 Indexing data frames Data frames can be subset using [row,column] syntax. geo[4,2] # A tibble: 1 x 1 region &lt;chr&gt; 1 europe Note that while this is a single value, it is still wrapped in a data frame. (This is a behaviour specific to Tidyverse data frames.) More on this in a moment. Columns can be given by name. geo[4,&quot;region&quot;] # A tibble: 1 x 1 region &lt;chr&gt; 1 europe The column or row may be omitted, thereby retrieving the entire row or column. geo[4,] # A tibble: 1 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Andorra europe FALSE FALSE 42.5 1.52 high geo[,&quot;region&quot;] # A tibble: 196 x 1 region &lt;chr&gt; 1 asia 2 europe 3 africa 4 europe 5 africa 6 americas 7 americas 8 europe 9 asia 10 europe # ... with 186 more rows Multiple rows or columns may be retrieved using a vector. rows_wanted &lt;- c(1,3,5) geo[rows_wanted,] # A tibble: 3 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Afghanistan asia FALSE TRUE 33 66 low 2 Algeria africa FALSE TRUE 28 3 upper_mid 3 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid Vector indexing can also be written on a single line. geo[c(1,3,5),] # A tibble: 3 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Afghanistan asia FALSE TRUE 33 66 low 2 Algeria africa FALSE TRUE 28 3 upper_mid 3 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid geo[1:7,] # A tibble: 7 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Afghanistan asia FALSE TRUE 33 66 low 2 Albania europe FALSE FALSE 41 20 upper_mid 3 Algeria africa FALSE TRUE 28 3 upper_mid 4 Andorra europe FALSE FALSE 42.5 1.52 high 5 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid 6 Antigua and Barbuda americas FALSE TRUE 17.0 -61.8 high 7 Argentina americas FALSE TRUE -34 -64 upper_mid 2.4 Columns are vectors Ok, so how do we actually get data out of a data frame? Under the hood, a data frame is a list of column vectors. We can use $ to retrieve columns. Occasionally it is also useful to use [[ ]] to retrieve columns, for example if the column name we want is stored in a variable. head( geo$region ) [1] &quot;asia&quot; &quot;europe&quot; &quot;africa&quot; &quot;europe&quot; &quot;africa&quot; &quot;americas&quot; head( geo[[&quot;region&quot;]] ) [1] &quot;asia&quot; &quot;europe&quot; &quot;africa&quot; &quot;europe&quot; &quot;africa&quot; &quot;americas&quot; To get the “region” value of the 4th row as above, but unwrapped, we can use: geo$region[4] [1] &quot;europe&quot; For example, to plot the longitudes and latitudes we could use: plot(geo$long, geo$lat) 2.5 Logical indexing A method of indexing that we haven’t discussed yet is logical indexing. Instead of specifying the row number or numbers that we want, we can give a logical vector which is TRUE for the rows we want and FALSE otherwise. This can also be used with vectors. We will first do this in a slightly verbose way in order to understand it, then learn a more concise way to do this using the dplyr package. Southern countries have latitude less than zero. is_southern &lt;- geo$lat &lt; 0 head(is_southern) [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE sum(is_southern) [1] 40 sum treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it tells us the number of TRUE elements in the vector. We can use this logical vector to get the southern countries from geo: geo[is_southern,] # A tibble: 40 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid 2 Argentina americas FALSE TRUE -34 -64 upper_mid 3 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high 4 Bolivia americas FALSE TRUE -17 -65 lower_mid 5 Botswana africa FALSE TRUE -22 24 upper_mid 6 Brazil americas FALSE TRUE -10 -55 upper_mid 7 Burundi africa FALSE TRUE -3.5 30 low 8 Chile americas TRUE TRUE -33.5 -70.6 high 9 Comoros africa FALSE TRUE -12.2 44.4 low 10 Congo, Dem. Rep. africa FALSE TRUE -2.5 23.5 low # ... with 30 more rows Comparison operators available are: x == y – “equal to” x != y – “not equal to” x &lt; y – “less than” x &gt; y – “greater than” x &lt;= y – “less than or equal to” x &gt;= y – “greater than or equal to” More complicated conditions can be constructed using logical operators: a &amp; b – “and”, TRUE only if both a and b are TRUE. a | b – “or”, TRUE if either a or b or both are TRUE. ! a – “not” , TRUE if a is FALSE, and FALSE if a is TRUE. The oecd column of geo tells which countries are in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the g77 column tells which countries are in the Group of 77 (an alliance of developing nations). We could see which OECD countries are in the southern hemisphere with: southern_oecd &lt;- is_southern &amp; geo$oecd geo[southern_oecd,] # A tibble: 3 x 7 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high 2 Chile americas TRUE TRUE -33.5 -70.6 high 3 New Zealand asia TRUE FALSE -42 174 high is_southern seems like it should be kept within our geo data frame for future use. We can add it as a new column of the data frame with: geo$southern &lt;- is_southern geo # A tibble: 196 x 8 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 southern &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 Afghanistan asia FALSE TRUE 33 66 low FALSE 2 Albania europe FALSE FALSE 41 20 upper_mid FALSE 3 Algeria africa FALSE TRUE 28 3 upper_mid FALSE 4 Andorra europe FALSE FALSE 42.5 1.52 high FALSE 5 Angola africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 18.5 lower_mid TRUE 6 Antigua and Barb… americ… FALSE TRUE 17.0 -61.8 high FALSE 7 Argentina americ… FALSE TRUE -34 -64 upper_mid TRUE 8 Armenia europe FALSE FALSE 40.2 45 lower_mid FALSE 9 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high TRUE 10 Austria europe TRUE FALSE 47.3 13.3 high FALSE # ... with 186 more rows Challenge: logical indexing Which country is in both the OECD and the G77? Which countries are in neither the OECD nor the G77? Which countries are in the Americas? These have longitudes between -150 and -40. 2.5.1 A dplyr shorthand The above method is a little laborious. We have to keep mentioning the name of the data frame, and there is a lot of punctuation to keep track of. dplyr provides a slightly magical function called filter which lets us write more concisely. For example: filter(geo, lat &lt; 0 &amp; oecd) # A tibble: 3 x 8 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 southern &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high TRUE 2 Chile americas TRUE TRUE -33.5 -70.6 high TRUE 3 New Zealand asia TRUE FALSE -42 174 high TRUE In the second argument, we are able to refer to columns of the data frame as though they were variables. The code is beautiful, but also opaque. It’s important to understand that under the hood we are creating and combining logical vectors. 2.6 Factors The count function from dplyr can help us understand the contents of some of the columns in geo. count is also magical, we can refer to columns of the data frame directly in the arguments to count. count(geo, region) # A tibble: 4 x 2 region n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 africa 54 2 americas 35 3 asia 59 4 europe 48 count(geo, income2017) # A tibble: 4 x 2 income2017 n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 high 58 2 low 31 3 lower_mid 52 4 upper_mid 55 One annoyance here is that the different categories in income2017 aren’t in a sensible order. This comes up quite often, for example when sorting or plotting categorical data. R’s solution is a further type of vector called a factor (think a factor of an experimental design). A factor holds categorical data, and has an associated ordered set of levels. It is otherwise quite similar to a character vector. Any sort of vector can be converted to a factor using the factor function. This function defaults to placing the levels in alphabetical order, but takes a levels argument that can override this. head( factor(geo$income2017, levels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;lower_mid&quot;,&quot;upper_mid&quot;,&quot;high&quot;)) ) [1] low upper_mid upper_mid high lower_mid high Levels: low lower_mid upper_mid high We should to modify the income2017 column of the geo table in order to use this: geo$income2017 &lt;- factor(geo$income2017, levels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;lower_mid&quot;,&quot;upper_mid&quot;,&quot;high&quot;)) count now produces the desired order of output: count(geo, income2017) # A tibble: 4 x 2 income2017 n &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 low 31 2 lower_mid 52 3 upper_mid 55 4 high 58 When plot is given a factor, it shows a bar plot: plot(geo$income2017) When given two factors, it shows a mosaic plot: plot(geo$income2017, factor(geo$oecd)) Similarly we can count two categorical columns at once. count(geo, income2017, oecd) # A tibble: 6 x 3 income2017 oecd n &lt;fct&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 low FALSE 31 2 lower_mid FALSE 52 3 upper_mid FALSE 53 4 upper_mid TRUE 2 5 high FALSE 29 6 high TRUE 29 2.7 Readability vs tidyness The counts we obtained counting income2017 vs oecd were properly tidy in the sense of containing a single unit of observation per row. However to view the data, it would be more convenient to have income as columns and OECD membership as rows. We can use the spread function from tidyr to achieve this. counts &lt;- count(geo, income2017, oecd) spread(counts, key=income2017, value=n, fill=0) # A tibble: 2 x 5 oecd low lower_mid upper_mid high &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 FALSE 31 52 53 29 2 TRUE 0 0 2 29 Here: The key column became column names. The value column became the values in the new columns. The fill value is used to fill in any missing values. Tip Tidying is often the first step when exploring a data-set. The tidyr package contains a number of useful functions that help tidy (or un-tidy!) data. We’ve just seen spread which spreads two columns into multiple columns. The inverse of spread is gather, which gathers multiple columns into two columns: a column of column names, and a column of values. Challenge: counting Investigate how many OECD and non-OECD nations come from the northern and southern hemispheres. Using count. By making a mosaic plot. Remember you may need to convert columns to factors for plot to work, and that a southern column could be added to geo with: geo$southern &lt;- geo$lat &lt; 0 2.8 Sorting Data frames can be sorted using the arrange function in dplyr. arrange(geo, lat) # A tibble: 196 x 8 name region oecd g77 lat long income2017 southern &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 New Zealand asia TRUE FALSE -42 174 high TRUE 2 Argentina americas FALSE TRUE -34 -64 upper_mid TRUE 3 Chile americas TRUE TRUE -33.5 -70.6 high TRUE 4 Uruguay americas FALSE TRUE -33 -56 high TRUE 5 Lesotho africa FALSE TRUE -29.5 28.2 lower_mid TRUE 6 South Africa africa FALSE TRUE -29 24 upper_mid TRUE 7 Swaziland africa FALSE TRUE -26.5 31.5 lower_mid TRUE 8 Australia asia TRUE FALSE -25 135 high TRUE 9 Paraguay americas FALSE TRUE -23.3 -58 upper_mid TRUE 10 Botswana africa FALSE TRUE -22 24 upper_mid TRUE # ... with 186 more rows Numeric columns are sorted in numeric order.

This is from the Gapminder project and contains information about countries over time. gap &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/gap-minder.csv&quot;) gap # A tibble: 4,312 x 5 name year population gdp_percap life_exp &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Afghanistan 1800 3280000 603 28.2 2 Albania 1800 410445 667 35.4 3 Algeria 1800 2503218 715 28.8 4 Andorra 1800 2654 1197 NA 5 Angola 1800 1567028 618 27.0 6 Antigua and Barbuda 1800 37000 757 33.5 7 Argentina 1800 534000 1507 33.2 8 Armenia 1800 413326 514 34 9 Australia 1800 351014 814 34.0 10 Austria 1800 3205587 1847 34.4 # ... with 4,302 more rows Quiz What is the unit of observation in this new data frame? It would be useful to have general information about countries from geo available as columns when we use this data frame. gap and geo share a column called name which can be used to match rows from one to the other. gap_geo &lt;- left_join(gap, geo, by=&quot;name&quot;) gap_geo # A tibble: 4,312 x 12 name year population gdp_percap life_exp region oecd g77 lat &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Afghanis… 1800 3280000 603 28.2 asia FALSE TRUE 33 2 Albania 1800 410445 667 35.4 europe FALSE FALSE 41 3 Algeria 1800 2503218 715 28.8 africa FALSE TRUE 28 4 Andorra 1800 2654 1197 NA europe FALSE FALSE 42.5 5 Angola 1800 1567028 618 27.0 africa FALSE TRUE -12.5 6 Antigua … 1800 37000 757 33.5 ameri… FALSE TRUE 17.0 7 Argentina 1800 534000 1507 33.2 ameri… FALSE TRUE -34 8 Armenia 1800 413326 514 34 europe FALSE FALSE 40.2 9 Australia 1800 351014 814 34.0 asia TRUE FALSE -25 10 Austria 1800 3205587 1847 34.4 europe TRUE FALSE 47.3 # ... with 4,302 more rows, and 3 more variables: long &lt;dbl&gt;, # income2017 &lt;fct&gt;, southern &lt;lgl&gt; The output contains all ways of pairing up rows by name. In this case each row of geo pairs up with multiple rows of gap. The “left” in “left join” refers to how rows that can’t be paired up are handled. left_join keeps all rows from the first data frame but not the second. This is a good default when the intent is to attaching some extra information to a data frame. inner_join discard all rows that can’t be paired up. full_join keeps all rows from both data frames. 2.10 Further reading We’ve covered the fundamentals of dplyr and data frames, but there is much more to learn. Notably, we haven’t covered the use of the pipe %&gt;% to chain dplyr verbs together. The “R for Data Science” book is an excellent source to learn more. The Monash Bioinformatics Platform “R more” course also covers this. "],
["plotting-with-ggplot2.html", "3 Plotting with ggplot2 3.1 Elements of a ggplot 3.2 Further geoms 3.3 Highlighting subsets 3.4 Fine-tuning a plot 3.5 Faceting 3.6 Saving ggplots", " 3 Plotting with ggplot2 We already saw some of R’s built in plotting facilities with the function plot. A more recent and much more powerful plotting library is ggplot2. ggplot2 is another mini-language within R, a language for creating plots. It implements ideas from a book called “The Grammar of Graphics”. The syntax can be a little strange, but there are plenty of examples in the online documentation. ggplot2 is part of the Tidyverse, so loadinging the tidyverse package will load ggplot2. library(tidyverse) We continue with the Gapminder dataset, which we loaded with: geo &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/geo.csv&quot;) gap &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/gap-minder.csv&quot;) gap_geo &lt;- left_join(gap, geo, by=&quot;name&quot;) 3.1 Elements of a ggplot Producing a plot with ggplot2, we must give three things: A data frame containing our data. How the columns of the data frame can be translated into positions, colors, sizes, and shapes of graphical elements (“aesthetics”). The actual graphical elements to display (“geometric objects”). Let’s make our first ggplot. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() The call to ggplot and aes sets up the basics of how we are going to represent the various columns of the data frame. aes defines the “aesthetics”, which is how columns of the data frame map to graphical attributes such as x and y position, color, size, etc. aes is another example of magic “non-standard evaluation”, arguments to aes may refer to columns of the data frame directly. We then literally add layers of graphics (“geoms”) to this. Further aesthetics can be used. Any aesthetic can be either numeric or categorical, an appropriate scale will be used. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, color=region, size=population)) + geom_point() 3.1.1 Challenge: make a ggplot This R code will get the data from the year 2010: gap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010) Create a ggplot of this with: gdp_percap as x. life_exp as y. population as the size. region as the color. 3.2 Further geoms To draw lines, we need to use a “group” aesthetic. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name, color=region)) + geom_line() A wide variety of geoms are available. Here we show Tukey box-plots. Note again the use of the “group” aesthetic, without this ggplot will just show one big box-plot. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=year)) + geom_boxplot() geom_smooth can be used to show trends. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; Aesthetics can be specified globally in ggplot, or as the first argument to individual geoms. Here, the “group” is applied only to draw the lines, and “color” is used to produce multiple trend lines: ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_line(aes(group=name)) + geom_smooth(aes(color=oecd)) `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; 3.3 Highlighting subsets Geoms can be added that use a different data frame, using the data= argument. gap_australia &lt;- filter(gap_geo, name == &quot;Australia&quot;) ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name)) + geom_line() + geom_line(data=gap_australia, color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2) Notice also that the second geom_line has some further arguments controlling its appearance. These are not aesthetics, they are not a mapping of data to appearance, but rather a direct specification of the appearance. There isn’t an associated scale as when color was an aesthetic. 3.4 Fine-tuning a plot Adding labs to a ggplot adjusts the labels given to the axes and legends. A plot title can also be specified. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Life expectancy&quot;, title=&quot;Gapminder&quot;) coord_cartesian can be used to set the limits of the x and y axes. Suppose we want our y-axis to start at zero. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,90)) Type scale_ and press the tab key. You will see functions giving fine-grained controls over various scales (x, y, color, etc). These allow transformations (eg log10), and manually specified breaks (labelled values). Very fine grained control is possible over the appearance of ggplots, see the ggplot2 documentation for details and further examples. 3.4.1 Challenge: refine your ggplot Continuing with your scatter-plot of the 2010 data, add axis labels to your plot. Give your x axis a log scale by adding scale_x_log10(). 3.5 Faceting Faceting lets us quickly produce a collection of small plots. The plots all have the same scales and the eye can easily compare them. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ region) Note the use of ~, which we’ve not seen before. ~ syntax is used in R to specify dependence on some set of variables, for example when specifying a linear model. Here the information in each plot is dependent on the continent. 3.5.1 Challenge: facet your ggplot Let’s return again to your scatter-plot of the 2010 data. Adjust your plot to now show data from all years, with each year shown in a separate facet, using facet_wrap(~ year). Advanced: Highlight Australia in your plot. 3.6 Saving ggplots The act of plotting a ggplot is actually triggered when it is printed. In an interactive session we are automatically printing each value we calculate, but if you are using it with a programming construct such as a for loop or function you might need to explcitly print( ) the plot. Ggplots can be saved using ggsave. # Plot created but not shown. p &lt;- ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() # Only when we try to look at the value p is it shown p # Alternatively, we can explicitly print it print(p) # To save to a file ggsave(&quot;test.png&quot;, p) # This is an alternative method that works with &quot;base R&quot; plots as well: png(&quot;test.png&quot;) print(p) dev.off() "],
["summarizing-data.html", "4 Summarizing data 4.1 Summary functions 4.2 Missing values 4.3 Grouped summaries 4.4 t-test", " 4 Summarizing data Having loaded and thoroughly explored a data set, we are ready to distill it down to concise conclusions. At its simplest, this involves calculating summary statistics like counts, means, and standard deviations. Beyond this is the fitting of models, and hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculation. R has a huge number of packages devoted to these tasks and this is a large part of its appeal, but is beyond the scope of today. Loading the data as before, if you have not already done so: library(tidyverse) geo &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/geo.csv&quot;) gap &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/gap-minder.csv&quot;) gap_geo &lt;- left_join(gap, geo, by=&quot;name&quot;) 4.1 Summary functions R has a variety of functions for summarizing a vector, including: sum, mean, min, max, median, sd. mean( c(1,2,3,4) ) [1] 2.5 We can use these on the Gapminder data. gap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010) sum(gap2010$population) [1] 6949495061 mean(gap2010$life_exp) [1] NA 4.2 Missing values Why did mean fail?

If we try to calculate with NA, the result is NA NA + 1 [1] NA is.na can be used to detect NA values, or na.omit can be used to directly remove rows of a data frame containing them. is.na( c(1,2,NA,3) ) [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE cleaned &lt;- filter(gap2010, !is.na(life_exp)) weighted.mean(cleaned$life_exp, cleaned$population) [1] 70.96192 4.3 Grouped summaries The summarize function in dplyr allows summary functions to be applied to data frames. summarize(gap2010, mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean_life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 1 71.0 So far unremarkable, but summarize comes into its own when the group_by “adjective” is used. summarize( group_by(gap_geo, year), mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) # A tibble: 22 x 2 year mean_life_exp &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1800 30.9 2 1810 31.1 3 1820 31.2 4 1830 31.4 5 1840 31.4 6 1850 31.6 7 1860 30.3 8 1870 31.5 9 1880 32.0 10 1890 32.5 # ... with 12 more rows Challenge: summarizing What is the total population for each year? Plot the result. Advanced: What is the total GDP for each year? For this you will first need to calculate GDP per capita times the population of each country. group_by can be used to group by multiple columns, much like count. We can use this to see how the rest of the world is catching up to OECD nations in terms of life expectancy. result &lt;- summarize( group_by(gap_geo,year,oecd), mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) result # A tibble: 44 x 3 # Groups: year [?] year oecd mean_life_exp &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1800 FALSE 29.9 2 1800 TRUE 34.7 3 1810 FALSE 29.9 4 1810 TRUE 35.2 5 1820 FALSE 30.0 6 1820 TRUE 35.9 7 1830 FALSE 30.0 8 1830 TRUE 36.2 9 1840 FALSE 30.0 10 1840 TRUE 36.2 # ... with 34 more rows ggplot(result, aes(x=year,y=mean_life_exp,color=oecd)) + geom_line() A similar plot could be produced using geom_smooth. Differences here are that we have full control over the summarization process so we were able to use the exact summarization method we want (weighted.mean for each year), and we have access to the resulting numeric data as well as the plot. We have reduced a large data set down to a smaller one that distills out one of the stories present in this data. However the earlier visualization and exploration activity using ggplot2 was essential. It gave us an idea of what sort of variability was present in the data, and any unexpected issues the data might have. 4.4 t-test We will finish this section by demonstrating a t-test. The main point of this section is to give a flavour of how statistical tests work in R, rather than the details of what a t-test does. Has life expectancy increased from 2000 to 2010? gap2000 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2000) gap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010) t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp) Welch Two Sample t-test data: gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp t = 3.0341, df = 374.98, p-value = 0.002581 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 1.023455 4.792947 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 70.34005 67.43185 Statistical routines often have many ways to tweak the details of their operation. These are specified by further arguments to the function call, to override the default behaviour. By default, t.test performs an unpaired t-test, but these are repeated observations of the same countries. We can specify paired=TRUE to t.test to perform a paired sample t-test and gain some statistical power. Check this by looking at the help page with ?t.test. It’s important to first check that both data frames are in the same order. all(gap2000$name == gap2010$name) [1] TRUE t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp t = 13.371, df = 188, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 2.479153 3.337249 sample estimates: mean of the differences 2.908201 When performing a statistical test, it’s good practice to visualize the data to make sure there is nothing funny going on. plot(gap2000$life_exp, gap2010$life_exp) abline(0,1) This is a visual confirmation of the t-test result. If there were no difference between the years then points would lie approximately evenly above and below the diagonal line, which is clearly not the case. However the outlier may warrant investigation. "],
["thinking-in-r.html", "5 Thinking in R 5.1 Lists 5.2 Other types not covered here 5.3 Programming", " 5 Thinking in R The result of a t-test is actually a value we can manipulate further. Two functions help us here. class gives the “public face” of a value, and typeof gives its underlying type, the way R thinks of it internally. For example numbers are “numeric” and have some representation in computer memory, either “integer” for whole numbers only, or “double” which can hold fractional numbers (stored in memory in a base-2 version of scientific notation). class(42) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; typeof(42) [1] &quot;double&quot; Let’s look at the result of a t-test: result &lt;- t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp, paired=TRUE) class(result) [1] &quot;htest&quot; typeof(result) [1] &quot;list&quot; names(result) [1] &quot;statistic&quot; &quot;parameter&quot; &quot;p.value&quot; &quot;conf.int&quot; &quot;estimate&quot; [6] &quot;null.value&quot; &quot;alternative&quot; &quot;method&quot; &quot;data.name&quot; result$p.value [1] 4.301261e-29 In R, a t-test is just another function returning just another type of data, so it can also be a building block. The value it returns is a special type of vector called a “list”, but with a public face that presents itself nicely. This is a common pattern in R. Besides printing to the console nicely, this public face may alter the behaviour of generic functions such as plot and summary. Similarly a data frame is a list of vectors that is able to present itself nicely. 5.1 Lists Lists are vectors that can hold anything as elements (even other lists!). It’s possible to create lists with the list function. This becomes especially useful once you get into the programming side of R. For example writing your own function that needs to return multiple values, it could do so in the form of a list. mylist &lt;- list(hello=c(&quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;), numbers=c(1,2,3,4)) mylist $hello [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; $numbers [1] 1 2 3 4 class(mylist) [1] &quot;list&quot; typeof(mylist) [1] &quot;list&quot; names(mylist) [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;numbers&quot; Accessing lists can be done by name with $ or by position with [[ ]]. mylist$hello [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; mylist[[2]] [1] 1 2 3 4 5.2 Other types not covered here Matrices are another tabular data type. These come up when doing more mathematical tasks in R. They are also commonly used in bioinformatics, for example to represent RNA-Seq count data. A matrix, as compared to a data frame: contains only one type of data, usually numeric (rather than different types in different columns). commonly has rownames as well as colnames. (Base R data frames can have rownames too, but it is easier to have any unique identifier as a normal column instead.) has individual cells as the unit of observation (rather than rows). Matrices can be created using as.matrix from a data frame, matrix from a single vector, or using rbind or cbind with several vectors. You may also encounter “S4 objects”, especially if you use Bioconductor packages. The syntax for using these is different again, and uses @ to access elements. 5.3 Programming Once you have a useful data analysis, you may want to do it again with different data. You may have some task that needs to be done many times over. This is where programming comes in: Writing your own functions. For-loops to do things multiple times. If-statements to make decisions. The “R for Data Science” book is an excellent source to learn more. The Monash Bioinformatics Platform “R more” course also covers this. "],

Also, statistical tasks such as model fitting, hypothesis testing, confidence interval calculation, and prediction are a large part of R, and one we haven’t demonstrated fully today. “Modern Applied Statistics with S” by W.N. Venable and B.D. Ripley is a well respected reference covering R and its predecessor S. “Linear Models with R” and “Extending the Linear Model with R” by Julian J. Faraway cover linear models, with many practical examples. Linear models, and the linear model formula syntax ~, are core to much of what R has to offer statistically. Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including limma for differential gene expression, glm for logistic regression (etc), survival analysis with coxph, and mixed models to characterize variation within populations. 6.2 Expand your vocabulary Have a look at these cheat sheets to see what is possible with R. RStudio’s collection of cheat sheets cover newer packages in R. An old-school cheat sheet for dinosaurs and people wishing to go deeper. Bioconductor cheat sheet for biological data. 6.3 Join the community Join the Data Fluency community at Monash. Mailing list for workshop and event announcements. Slack for discussion.
