We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using &lt;-.\nwidth &lt;- 5\nRStudio helpfully shows us the variable in the “Environment” pane. We can also print it by typing the name of the variable and hitting enter. In general, R will print to the console any object returned by a function or operation unless we assign it to a variable.\nwidth\n\n[1] 5\nExamples of valid variables names: hello, subject_id, subject.ID, x42. Spaces aren’t ok inside variable names. Dots (.) are ok in R, unlike in many other languages. Numbers are ok, except as the first character. Punctuation is not allowed, with two exceptions: _ and ..\nWe can do arithmetic with the variable:\n# Area of a square\nwidth * width\n\n[1] 25\nand even save the result in another variable:\n# Save area in \"area\" variable\narea &lt;- width * width\nWe can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new value:\nwidth &lt;- 10\nwidth\n\n[1] 10\n\narea\n\n[1] 25\nNotice that the value of area we calculated earlier hasn’t been updated. Assigning a new value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. This is different to a spreadsheet, but usual for programming languages.",

Go to “File/New File/R Script” to create a new R script. Code in your R script can be sent to the console by selecting it or placing the cursor on the correct line, and then pressing Control-Enter (Command-Enter on a Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdd comments to code, using lines starting with the # character.

We call the individual numbers elements of the vector.\nWe can make vectors with c( ), for example c(1,2,3). c means “combine”. R is obsesssed with vectors, in R even single numbers are vectors of length one. Many things that can be done with a single number can also be done with a vector. For example arithmetic can be done on vectors as it can be on single numbers.\n\nmyvec &lt;- c(10,20,30,40,50)\nmyvec\n\n[1] 10 20 30 40 50\n\nmyvec + 1\n\n[1] 11 21 31 41 51\n\nmyvec + myvec\n\n[1]  20  40  60  80 100\n\nlength(myvec)\n\n[1] 5\n\nc(60, myvec)\n\n[1] 60 10 20 30 40 50\n\nc(myvec, myvec)\n\n [1] 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50\n\n\nWhen we talk about the length of a vector, we are talking about the number of numbers in the vector.",

Also we will encounter “logical” vectors, which contain TRUE and FALSE values. R also has “factors”, which are categorical vectors, and behave much like character vectors (think the factors in an experiment).\n\nChallenge: mixing types\nSometimes the best way to understand R is to try some examples and see what it does.\nWhat happens when you try to make a vector containing different types, using c( )? Make a vector with some numbers, and some words (eg. character strings like \"test\", or \"hello\").\nWhy does the output show the numbers surrounded by quotes \" \" like character strings are?\n\nBecause vectors can only contain one type of thing, R chooses a lowest common denominator type of vector, a type that can contain everything we are trying to put in it. A different language might stop with an error, but R tries to soldier on as best it can. A number can be represented as a character string, but a character string can not be represented as a number, so when we try to put both in the same vector R converts everything to a character string.",

    "text": "1.7 Functions\nFunctions are the things that do all the work for us in R: calculate, manipulate data, read and write to files, produce plots. R has many built in functions and we will also be loading more specialized functions from “packages”.\nWe’ve already seen several functions: c( ), length( ), and plot( ). Let’s now have a look at sum( ).\n\nsum(myvec)\n\n[1] 135\n\n\nWe called the function sum with the argument myvec, and it returned the value 135. We can get help on how to use sum with:\n?sum\nSome functions take more than one argument. Let’s look at the function rep, which means “repeat”, and which can take a variety of different arguments. In the simplest case, it takes a value and the number of times to repeat that value.\n\nrep(42, 10)\n\n [1] 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42\n\n\nAs with many functions in R—which is obsessed with vectors—the thing to be repeated can be a vector with multiple elements.\n\nrep(c(1,2,3), 10)\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\n\nSo far we have used positional arguments, where R determines which argument is which by the order in which they are given. We can also give arguments by name. For example, the above is equivalent to\n\nrep(c(1,2,3), times=10)\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\nrep(x=c(1,2,3), 10)\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\nrep(times=10, x=c(1,2,3))\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\n\nArguments can have default values, and a function may have many different possible arguments that make it do obscure things. For example, rep can also take an argument each=. It’s typical for a function to be invoked with some number of positional arguments, which are always given, plus some less commonly used arguments, typically given by name.\n\nrep(c(1,2,3), each=3)\n\n[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3\n\nrep(c(1,2,3), each=3, times=5)\n\n [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1\n[39] 1 2 2 2 3 3 3\n\n\n\nChallenge: using functions\n\nUse sum to sum from 1 to 10,000.\nLook at the documentation for the seq function. What does seq do? Give an example of using seq with either the by or length.out argument.",

We will get to this shortly.\n\nYou can also see this data frame referring to itself as “a tibble”. This is the Tidyverse’s improved form of data frame.

Base R data frames don’t show the type of each column, and output every row when you try to view them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA data frame can also be created from vectors, with the tibble function.

This says, starting from your working directory, look in the directory r-intro for the file geo.csv. The steps in the path are separated by /. Your working directory is shown at the top of the console pane. The path needed might be different on your own computer, depending where you downloaded the file.\nOne way to work out the correct path is to find the file in the file browser pane, click on it and select “Import Dataset…”.",

    "text": "2.6 Logical indexing\nA method of indexing that we haven’t discussed yet is logical indexing. Instead of specifying the row number or numbers that we want, we can give a logical vector which is TRUE for the rows we want and FALSE otherwise. This can also be used with vectors.\nWe will first do this in a slightly verbose way in order to understand it, then learn a more concise way to do this using the dplyr package.\nSouthern countries have latitude less than zero.\n\nis_southern &lt;- geo$lat &lt; 0\n\nhead(is_southern)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nsum(is_southern)\n\n[1] 40\n\n\nsum treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it tells us the number of TRUE elements in the vector.\nWe can use this logical vector to get the southern countries from geo:\n\ngeo[is_southern,]\n\n# A tibble: 40 × 7\n   name             region oecd  g77       lat  long income2017\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 Australia        asia   TRUE  FALSE -25      135  high      \n 2 Fiji             asia   FALSE TRUE  -18      178  upper_mid \n 3 Indonesia        asia   FALSE TRUE   -5      120  lower_mid \n 4 Nauru            asia   FALSE FALSE  -0.517  167. upper_mid \n 5 New Zealand      asia   TRUE  FALSE -42      174  high      \n 6 Papua New Guinea asia   FALSE TRUE   -6      147  lower_mid \n 7 Samoa            asia   FALSE TRUE  -13.8   -172. upper_mid \n 8 Solomon Islands  asia   FALSE TRUE   -8      159  lower_mid \n 9 Timor-Leste      asia   FALSE TRUE   -8.83   126. lower_mid \n10 Tonga            asia   FALSE TRUE  -20     -175  upper_mid \n# ℹ 30 more rows\n\n\nComparison operators available are:\n\nx == y – “equal to”\nx != y – “not equal to”\nx &lt; y – “less than”\nx &gt; y – “greater than”\nx &lt;= y – “less than or equal to”\nx &gt;= y – “greater than or equal to”\n\nMore complicated conditions can be constructed using logical operators:\n\na & b – “and”, TRUE only if both a and b are TRUE.\na | b – “or”, TRUE if either a or b or both are TRUE.\n! a – “not” , TRUE if a is FALSE, and FALSE if a is TRUE.\n\nThe oecd column of geo tells which countries are in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the g77 column tells which countries are in the Group of 77 (an alliance of developing nations). We could see which OECD countries are in the southern hemisphere with:\n\nsouthern_oecd &lt;- is_southern & geo$oecd\n\ngeo[southern_oecd,]\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  name        region   oecd  g77     lat  long income2017\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 Australia   asia     TRUE  FALSE -25   135   high      \n2 New Zealand asia     TRUE  FALSE -42   174   high      \n3 Chile       americas TRUE  TRUE  -33.5 -70.6 high      \n\n\nis_southern seems like it should be kept within our geo data frame for future use.

These have longitudes between -150 and -40.\n\n\n\n2.6.1 A dplyr shorthand\nThe above method is a little laborious. We have to keep mentioning the name of the data frame, and there is a lot of punctuation to keep track of. dplyr provides a slightly magical function called filter which lets us write more concisely. For example:\n\nfilter(geo, lat &lt; 0 & oecd)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 8\n  name        region   oecd  g77     lat  long income2017 southern\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;lgl&gt;   \n1 Australia   asia     TRUE  FALSE -25   135   high       TRUE    \n2 New Zealand asia     TRUE  FALSE -42   174   high       TRUE    \n3 Chile       americas TRUE  TRUE  -33.5 -70.6 high       TRUE    \n\n\nIn the second argument, we are able to refer to columns of the data frame as though they were variables. The code is beautiful, but also opaque. It’s important to understand that under the hood we are creating and combining logical vectors.",

This comes up quite often, for example when sorting or plotting categorical data. R’s solution is a further type of vector called a factor (think a factor of an experimental design). A factor holds categorical data, and has an associated ordered set of levels. It is otherwise quite similar to a character vector.\nAny sort of vector can be converted to a factor using the factor function. This function defaults to placing the levels in alphabetical order, but takes a levels argument that can override this.\n\nhead( factor(geo$income2017, levels=c(\"low\",\"lower_mid\",\"upper_mid\",\"high\")) )\n\n[1] high      high      lower_mid upper_mid upper_mid high     \nLevels: low lower_mid upper_mid high\n\n\nWe should modify the income2017 column of the geo table in order to use this:\n\ngeo$income2017 &lt;- factor(geo$income2017, levels=c(\"low\",\"lower_mid\",\"upper_mid\",\"high\"))\n\ncount now produces the desired order of output:\n\ncount(geo, income2017)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  income2017     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 low           31\n2 lower_mid     52\n3 upper_mid     55\n4 high          58\n\n\nWhen plot is given a factor, it shows a bar plot:\n\nplot(geo$income2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen given two factors, it shows a mosaic plot:\n\nplot(geo$income2017, factor(geo$oecd))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly we can count two categorical columns at once.\n\ncount(geo, income2017, oecd)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  income2017 oecd      n\n  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 low        FALSE    31\n2 lower_mid  FALSE    52\n3 upper_mid  FALSE    53\n4 upper_mid  TRUE      2\n5 high       FALSE    29\n6 high       TRUE     29",

The tidyr package contains a number of useful functions that help tidy (or un-tidy!) data. We’ve just seen pivot_wider which spreads two columns into multiple columns. The inverse of pivot_wider is pivot_longer, which gathers multiple columns into two columns: a column of column names, and a column of values. pivot_longer is often the first step when tidying a dataset you have received from the wild.

Differences here are that we have full control over the summarization process so we were able to use the exact summarization method we want (weighted.mean for each year), and we have access to the resulting numeric data as well as the plot. We have reduced a large data set down to a smaller one that distills out one of the stories present in this data. However the earlier visualization and exploration activity using ggplot2 was essential. It gave us an idea of what sort of variability was present in the data, and any unexpected issues the data might have.",

The main point of this section is to give a flavour of how statistical tests work in R, rather than the details of what a t-test does.\nHas life expectancy increased from 2000 to 2010?\n\ngap2000 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2000)\ngap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010)\n\nt.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp\nt = 3.0341, df = 374.98, p-value = 0.002581\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.023455 4.792947\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 70.34005  67.43185 \n\n\nStatistical routines often have many ways to tweak the details of their operation. These are specified by further arguments to the function call, to override the default behaviour. By default, t.test performs an unpaired t-test, but these are repeated observations of the same countries. We can specify paired=TRUE to t.test to perform a paired sample t-test and gain some statistical power. Check this by looking at the help page with ?t.test.\nIt’s important to first check that both data frames are in the same order.\n\nall(gap2000$name == gap2010$name)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nt.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp, paired=TRUE)\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp\nt = 13.371, df = 188, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 2.479153 3.337249\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n       2.908201 \n\n\nWhen performing a statistical test, it’s good practice to visualize the data to make sure there is nothing funny going on.\n\nplot(gap2000$life_exp, gap2010$life_exp)\nabline(0,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a visual confirmation of the t-test result. If there were no difference between the years then points would lie approximately evenly above and below the diagonal line, which is clearly not the case. However the outlier may warrant investigation.",

Examples include t.test from the previous sections, and also wilcox.test, fisher.test, chisq.test, and cor.test. Before applying these functions, you may need to use the methods we’ve learned today to subset and transform your data, or perform some preliminary summarization such as averaging technical replicates. To make sure there are no problems that might invalidate the results from these tests, always visualize your data. If you are performing many tests, adjust for multiple testing with p.adjust.\nGoing beyond this, linear models and the linear model formula syntax ~ are core to much of what R has to offer statistically. Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including limma for differential gene expression, glm for logistic regression (etc), survival analysis with coxph, and mixed models to characterize variation within populations.",
