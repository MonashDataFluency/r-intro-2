## Introducing R

R is a language and an environment for working with data.

\
We will primarily work with data by **writing R code**.

\
R has a large community of users and developers,\
and many specialized packages.



## Why code?

If every step of your analysis is recorded in an R script, with no manual steps:

* you have a complete record of what you have done
* changes easily tested, poor early decisions easily fixed
* today’s big project becomes a function in a package, serves as tomorrow’s building block

Programming is an essential part of **reproducible research**.

* other researchers can precisely understand and verify your work

\
R is open-source and free, so others can use your code without any barriers.

**Model** here is intended to cover a broad range of tasks:

* Summarize data with counts, means, etc.
* More generally "fit a model" to the data.
    * Traditional statistical models.
    * Machine learning models &rarr;
* Using the model, perform statistical tests.

Modelling is enabled and informed by the other steps!

* **Visualization** is critical to identify problems or make sure you are asking the right question.

* You need to **load** and **tidy** and maybe **transform** your data to plot and model it.

* Finally, you should **communicate** your results.

We've had a taste of the workflow in R. We've covered **loading**, touched on **tidying**, done some **visualization** and a little **modelling** (or at least summarization).

\
You still need to communicate your results, with your colleagues or the wider world! [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) can help with this.

Learning programming in R will super-charge your abilities. Writing your own functions, loops, packages, ...
